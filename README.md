## Refactoring exercise in Ruby

**Tech used**
* Ruby
* RSpec
* SimpleCov
* Rubocop

**To install this program**
* Fork and clone this repository
* Type `bundle install` in the command line

**To run the tests**
* Type `rspec` in the command line


**My approach**

I first made a [notes.md](notes.md) file to clarify the requirements of the program and task.

I next wrote out the complex nested if statement from the legacy code, and colour-coded the if/else pairs to understand the structure of the code. [See here.]()
